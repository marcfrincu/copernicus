# Copernicus Space Simulator
This repository contains one of my projects involving 3D space simulation by using OpenGL and C. It has been built in in 2009-2010 as part of my passion for astronomy. Since I was in highschool I loved simulating space. I started in Pascal with my own 3D simulation procedures then moved on to C# with DirectX and finally C with OpenGL. The simulator still have some bugs and TODOs but otherwise it is functional allowing you to move around the solar system and nearby stars. It displays a lot of asteroids and moons, many as 3D objects taken from public repositories. Given the long time I cannot remember all sources for data and models. It should run in both Windows and Linux.

It the time I was starting to develop this software like Celestia was being built.

If you are interesting in seeing how a simple simulator can be built (no shaders, shadows) you are invited to have a look.

The code I have here has been unchanged since 2010.

## Windows binary

The repository contains a precompiled binary part of the *copernicus-windows-binary.zip* file that should run on Windows 10.

## Linux

The executable for Linux is the file *copernicus.elf*. Unzip the images.zip archive in an images folder before running the application.

## Commands

You can use the mouse to look around and keys to perform various actions. You can find the commands in *copernicus.cpp*.
